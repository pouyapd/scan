# Introduction

SCAN (StatistiCal ANalyzer) is a statistical model checker
designed to verify large concurrent systems
for which standard verification techniques do not scale.

SCAN is currently under developement at DIBRIS, University of Genoa (UniGe)
in the context of the [CONVINCE project](https://convince-project.eu/).

API docs for the library crates are hosted at [https://convince-project.github.io/scan/crates/scan](https://convince-project.github.io/scan/crates/scan).
