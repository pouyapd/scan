//! Implementation of the PG model of computation.
//!
//! A _Program Graph_ is given by:
//!
//! - a finite set `L` of _locations_;
//! - a finite set `A` of _actions_;
//! - a finite set `V` of _typed variebles_;
//! - a _transition relation_ that associates pairs of locations (pre-location and post-location) and an action with a Boolean expression (the _guard_ of the transition);
//! - for each actions, a set of _effects_, i.e., a variabe `x` from `V` and an expression in the variables of `V` of the same type as `x`.
//!
//! The state of a PG is given by its current location and the value assigned to each variable.
//! The PG's state evolves by non-deterministically choosing a transition whose pre-state is the current state,
//! and whose guard expression evaluates to `true`.
//! Then, the post-state of the chosen transition becomes the current state of the PG.
//! Finally, the effects of the transition's associated action are applied in order,
//! by assigning each effect's variable the value of the effect's expression evaluation.
//!
//! A PG is represented by a [`ProgramGraph`] and defined through a [`ProgramGraphBuilder`],
//! by adding, one at a time, new locations, actions, effects, guards and transitions.
//! Then, the [`ProgramGraph`] is built from the [`ProgramGraphBuilder`]
//! and can be executed by performing transitions,
//! though the structure of the PG itself can no longer be altered.
//!
//! ```
//! # use scan_core::program_graph::ProgramGraphBuilder;
//! // Create a new PG builder
//! let mut pg_builder = ProgramGraphBuilder::new();
//!
//! // The builder is initialized with an initial location
//! let initial_loc = pg_builder.new_initial_location();
//!
//! // Create a new action
//! let action = pg_builder.new_action();
//!
//! // Create a new location
//! let post_loc = pg_builder.new_location();
//!
//! // Add a transition (the guard is optional, and None is equivalent to the guard always being true)
//! let result = pg_builder.add_transition(initial_loc, action, post_loc, None);
//!
//! // This can only fail if the builder does not recognize either the locations
//! // or the action defining the transition
//! result.expect("both the initial location and the action belong to the PG");
//!
//! // Build the PG from its builder
//! // The builder is always guaranteed to build a well-defined PG and building cannot fail
//! let mut pg = pg_builder.build();
//!
//! // Execution starts in the initial location
//! assert_eq!(pg.current_states(), &[initial_loc]);
//!
//! // Compute the possible transitions on the PG
//! assert_eq!(Vec::from_iter(pg.possible_transitions()), vec![(action, vec![vec![post_loc]])]);
//!
//! // Perform a transition
//! # use rand::{Rng, SeedableRng};
//! # use rand::rngs::SmallRng;
//! let mut rng = SmallRng::from_os_rng();
//! let result = pg.transition(action, vec![post_loc], &mut rng);
//!
//! // Performing a transition can fail, in particular, if the transition was not allowed
//! result.expect("The transition from the initial location onto itself is possible");
//!
//! // There are no more possible transitions
//! assert!(pg.possible_transitions().next().is_none());
//!
//! // Attempting to transition results in an error
//! pg.transition(action, vec![post_loc], &mut rng).expect_err("The transition is not possible");
//! ```
